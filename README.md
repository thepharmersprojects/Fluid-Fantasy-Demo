# Fluid Fantasy Demo

A tiny, single-file liquid-motion demo you can host with **GitHub Pages**.

## Quick deploy
1. Create a new public repo on GitHub (e.g., `fluid-fantasy-demo`).
2. Upload **index.html** to the repo root and commit.
3. Open **Settings → Pages**: set **Build and deployment** to *Deploy from a branch*, **Branch** = `main`, **Folder** = `/ (root)`.
4. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/fluid-fantasy-demo/` (the repo name).

**Use:** Tap anywhere to add droplets. Double-tap to flip gravity. On iPhone, tap **Enable Motion** when prompted so tilt works.
